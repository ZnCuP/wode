                            Is it better to choose original parts or non-original parts to replace a part? The original one is too expensive?
                        </button>
                        <div class="faq-answer active">
                            <p data-translate="answer1p1">Regarding the choice between original parts and non-original parts, it really needs to be considered according to the actual situation. Genuine parts are usually produced or authorized by the car manufacturer, the quality is more guaranteed, and the match with the vehicle is higher, but the price is relatively high. Non-genuine accessories are produced by third-party manufacturers, which are more affordable but of varying quality.</p>
                            
                            <p data-translate="answer1p2">For key safety components, such as braking system, steering system, seat belts, etc., it is strongly recommended to choose the original parts. Because these parts directly affect the safety of driving, the original parts have been rigorously tested and can provide better safety protection.</p>
                            
                            <p data-translate="answer1p3">For some non-critical parts, such as filter elements, light bulbs, windshield wipers, etc., you can choose cost-effective non-original parts, but be sure to choose the parts produced by regular manufacturers and meet the quality standards. You can refer to some well-known accessory brands, or consult our professional sales team, we will recommend the right accessories according to your model and needs.</p>
                            
                            <p data-translate="answer1p4">You can also consider our Ward brand accessories. We select high-quality suppliers to provide reliable quality and cost-effective parts, and provide one-year warranty service, you can rest assured.</p>
